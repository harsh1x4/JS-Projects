## Projects
- [Calculator-eval-Method](https://github.com/harsh1x4/Small-JS-Projects/tree/master/Calculator-eval-Method) - Made using HTML, CSS, and JS. I have used the eval method of JavaScript to solve the equations enclosed in it.
- [Random Color Generator](https://github.com/harsh1x4/Small-JS-Projects/tree/master/RandomColorGenerator) - Made using HTML, CSS, and JS. It will generate a random colour and give you the HEX code.
